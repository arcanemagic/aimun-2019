                                    <h3>Understanding Credibility of Sources</h3>
                                    During the research process, one of the most difficult questions that a researcher faces is the credibility of sources. While researching for an MUN, the context is the First thing to understand. As a Delegate, you are representing a specific branch of the government, that is the Permanent Representative of a nation in a specific committee. Hence, not all sources of information on the Internet would be considered credible. Based upon this context, priority should be given to sources belonging to the government itself. Some examples have been given in the section above – such as the website of the Permanent Representative itself, or various Ministries and Departments of the nation. Sometimes, if there are state-owned news agencies, they serve as credible information as well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    An important aspect to note is that there are times when information on these sources might contradict each other. In that case, investigate the source in relation to the topic and the structure of the government. For example, the statement of the President or the Prime Minister will be given credence over the statement by a political leader or a military official of the same government. In topics related to Human Rights for example, the Minister’s statement will be given more credibility than that of an official representing
                                    one of the other departments of the State.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is also important to understand that the nation you are representing might be a part of various regional and inter- governmental organisations, such as the United Nations, International Atomic Energy Agency, OPEC, NATO, OAS, ASEAN or the like. These can also form credible sources of research for topics that are discussed in the organisation. <b>However, do keep in mind that there are times when governments do not agree with the reports of articles of such organisations, especially when these reports and articles contain allegations against the state.</b> It is thus important, to study the relationship between the State and the Organisation before blindly accepting the reports. At another level, we are also students role-playing a diplomat. For basic understanding, one may use reports and articles on sources such as Wikipedia, or news agencies such as Al Jazeera and the BBC, or non-governmental bodies such as the Council on Foreign Relations, Amnesty International or Human Rights Watch, as they contain comprehensive background information on many topics. Please remember that for all information you wish to use in your speeches and statements within the committee, information from these sources must be corroborated or verified from the credible sources mentioned in the previous paragraphs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <h3>How to Research</h3>
                                    Often delegates face diffculties in researching. They do not know where to start from and how to derive important points from an article. At times, they are unable to understand certain documents and begin to lose interest in researching. Almost everyone tells them it is essential to research before going to the conference but they are not told how to research. This article shall brief you on how to research effectively. People believe that gathering information is equivalent to researching. This is not true. It is only one of the steps of being a well-researched delegate. Research means investigating. This involves understanding the topics being researched on from multiple perspectives and analysing it further. People also have this pre-conceived notion that they can research only by reading articles. Even in this they only read articles from credible sources. We wish to break this stereotype. Research can also be audio-visual. You may watch documentaries, news channels or listen to speeches, radio, etc. We mention credible sources to inform you that if a point of order is raised then we can rule it according to the respective sources. This does not imply that you cannot discuss issues that are not from credible sources. We want you to freely explore all the sources that you can. It will give you a better perspective that will not only help you in MUNs but will help you grow as an individual.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We understand that you all have limited time to research but do not leave this pursuit of researching even after this conference ends. Get yourselves emotionally invested in the agenda. To optimally u9 lose your limited 9me, it is important for you to ask the right questions. Research starts with the art of asking questions. Use all 5 W (why, when, where, what and who) and 1 H (How) questi9ons while addressing a sub-topic. For instance, if you come across a statement that 2 million people got displaced. Questions that you can probably raise are – who all were displaced, where does this displacement happened, what were the causes of this displacement, what all problems are these displaced people facing, when did this displacement occur, where are these displaced people living now, what resources they require, how are these displaced people rehabilitated, what is the government perspective on this, so on and so forth. You must have realised that we have used what, when, how, where and who, multiple times. You can do that too. Form as many questions as possible and then make notes accordingly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now when you are clear how you can pose questions, you may follow the below mentioned suggested pattern for researching: It is important to know the mandate of committee you are part of. For example, in the UN Human Rights Council, delegates have to limit themselves to the rights of human beings with respect to the agenda. If we do not understand what the mandate of this committee is, then we might even engage into the research of disaster management according to this agenda. It is the same way a student in the classroom is taught the same topic differently in History class and Political Science class. The same agenda can be discussed in UNGA SOCHUM and in UNHRC. It is the mandate that tells us which topic in the agenda can be discussed in which committees.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is important for you to research on the stance of the country you are representing. You must remind yourself that you are part of a Model UN conference and not a regular classroom discussion. Henceforth, it is required for you to research about the country you are a delegate of and know its foreign policy. There are certain core principles that your country holds – for example, USA believes in secularism on the contrary Saudi Arabia believes in one religion (Islam) or monotheism. These core principles are the defining feature of a country’s framework and cannot be changed easily. On the other hand, there are certain policies that can be changed depending upon the world scenario, for example, India saw a shift in certain policies when BJP came to power after Congress. We have observed that the delegates are unable to distinguish between these two types of foreign policies. You are not supposed to compromise on your country’s core principles. We understand that some of you find it difficult to chart out foreign policies. You come across different statements of your country’s leaders but they themselves do not explain much about the issue. In such a situation try finding answers for yourselves.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once you are bit clear with your country’s stance, you should start your research on the agenda. In order to do so, you must first break the agenda into different topics. You can break the topics into theme wise or region wise. You can also take a combination of both. For instance, in this agenda, you may pick a theme - rural-urban migration due to displacement. You may start your research on this topic and might find some generalised issues that is prevalent in almost every region. Once you have understood these generalised issues, you may pick a case study. For example, for this rural- urban migration, you find research on Ethiopia. Now you will understand problems on a micro-level; problems with the government, cultural differences, etc. These problems in itself are themes wise categorisation in a region. If you will continue to switch between theme wise research and region wise research, your analysis would become strong. You will understand both macro and micro level issues. One must try to understand the agenda from different stakeholders. For instance, if a committee is discussing Kashmir issue then one must try to understand its citizens’ perspective, state government’s perspective, Government of India and Pakistan perspective, UN’s perspective, non-state actors’ perspective, etc. When you listen to everyone’s point of view, you may get confused as well. I want you to stay for a while with this confusion. Write down your doubts and search for its answers. Maybe you cannot find it soon. Maybe for a long time, you do not have any conclusion too. But one day, you will definitely find your answers. Understanding multiple perspectives will completely change how you think and your knowledge will enhance automatically. This will help you in your academic pursuits. When you are done with all of this, you may then move on to the role that the international community has played in this agenda. Find out what all resolutions (solutions in a document) have been passed, how the UN is trying to solve these issues, what problems are there in the existing legal instruments, so on and so forth. This will aid your analysis and make your arguments strong.

                                    <h3>How to Write Chits</h3>
                                    In large committees, it is often felt by the delegates that the amount of recognition is quite less to cover all the points that they want to bring up in the committee. It has been observed that many delegates, generally, have certain issues with the chit system and its working and therefore, they tend to lose marks in this aspect. This document shall aim to clear your doubts and give you a better understanding of the chit system.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is important for you to know about the chits that contribute to the committee and the chits that are usually concerned with a delegate’s personal wishes. Therefore, for your understanding these chits are divided into Procedural Chits and Substantive Chits. Procedural Chits are concerned with Points of Personal Privilege such as if the delegate wants to be excused, if a delegate wants his/her name to be added to the GSL, or questions pertaining to points of parliamentary enquiry such as what is a GSL. These chits are not marked by the Executive Board. Substantive Chits are the chits that contribute to the debate. They are related to the agenda and can be addressed to the Executive Board or another delegate via Executive Board or both.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <h4>To Executive Board Chits</h4>
                                    To Executive Board Chits, as the name suggests, are addressed to the Executive Board. In these chits, delegates convey their content directly to the members of the Executive Board for evaluation. These chits when sent should portray a proper analysis and should be related to the agenda to be called substantive. We request you to highlight the points to make it easy for us to see your main points in the chits.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In chits you can straight away go to your point. There’s no need for you to write any introductory line such as the delegate of so and so would like to say... and so on. Try explaining your point as adequately as possible as you have ample time to write a chit. It is difficult to speak all the points in the stipulated time of the moderated caucus, or GSL, or PSL. In such a situation, if you have more points to add but could not mention them in your speech, then you can send them in a chit to the Executive Board. Irrespective of whether you have sent the chit to us or not, we expect you to convey your points to the committee as well, whenever you get time. In the end you are here to debate with the delegates and not with the Executive Board. We are just mere facilitators.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In our experience we have often observed that delegates copy text from the background guide or from some other sources and send us in a chit. In such a case where you find that a particular point requires attention, you need to paraphrase it in a way that it looks like it needs to be discussed in the committee. For that you can tell us in a chit why that point is important for us. For instance, if you come across the point in the background guide about rural-urban migration of displaced people; then send a chit which addresses the questions – why is it important to discuss in the committee, a brief introduction to the issue, how is it relevant to the agenda being discussed and if possible your country’s stance on that issue. Please ensure that you are paraphrasing. Any person can copy the entire background guide and send us in different chits. This is not what we want. We want you to understand it and then explain it to us in your words. Also, one should try to raise issues or points that guides the debate further.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A few delegates write in chits that they want recognition. We understand your concerns but at the same time where you write you want recognition, tell us why you want the recognition and what point you wish to raise. Even if we fail to give you recognition, we can make a note of your point. But this does not mean you would not speak those points in the committee which you have sent to us. You should make sure you share those points with your fellow delegates as well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Try elaborating your points while writing chits. Just don’t mention facts or Figure or what you wish to discuss. It is very important for us to know why you think it is relevant to inform us about the point. We have seen that they would say, for instance that they wish to discuss a particular topic but fail to tell us how they have conceptualised that topic. Some of them give facts and figures but fail to give analysis of the same. For example, do not just mention that 1 lac people were displaced from a country. Tell us, what exactly happened, how discussing that country is important to the debate, and so on. Understand this, it becomes difficult for us to assess your chits, if you are not communicating each point to us. As an Executive Board member we are not allowed to use our knowledge to draw links for you; it would become unfair for the committee.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Some of the delegates send different parts of the same point in different chits. You can send them all in one chit only. Executive Board does not mark according to the number of chits you are sending but how much sense you make in that chit. So a delegate who sends 5 chits and makes only 1 sensible point is equal to a delegate who sends 1 chit and makes 1 sensible point. Also at times, if you have written a chit well and analysed it from multiple perspectives then you can fetch quite a lot of marks from that single chit. There are delegates who try to predict future scenarios with the help of their research and analytical skills. They write their conclusions in the chits. In case you feel there is a need for you to do this, you should explain how you derived that conclusion instead of just writing the conclusion.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <h4>To Delegate and From Delegate Chits</h4>
                                    To delegate and from delegate chits only involve the delegates concerned, without the involvement of the Executive Board. They help you in lobbying, which is convincing others or building consensus. Exchange your ideas and points by writing chits to other delegates during the committee. Seek for clarifications, if you have any, from the delegates you think did not explain their point adequately. Try convincing others about your points. These are the chits which can bring committees to a consensus if used effectively.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Do not ignore these chits. We have seen that these are the chits that delegate hardly answer. These chits might not get marked but in the end seeing the committee we can actually make out how effectively you used these chits and there we can see your lobbying skills and diplomacy. So for the betterment of the committee use these chits properly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <h4>To Delegate Chits via Executive Board</h4>
                                    These are chits which are addressed to another delegate but are first received and read by the Executive Board and then forwarded to the mentioned delegate. They may consist of a question that the delegate has or an answer/reply to a question or if a delegate wants an explanation regarding a point spoken. These chits are sent to the Executive Board for them to be recognised and marked accordingly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Use these chits when you have points of information from the other delegate. At times, delegates engage into a discussion in these chits on an issue which is not relevant to the agenda. We appreciate your knowledge but we want you to discuss only those themes that are considered to be a part of the agenda.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It is important, in these chits, to make a demarcation where exactly you need to involve the Executive Board Members. When you need clarification regarding a point that some other delegate spoke, instead of sending via EB chits, send a chit to that delegate directly. Try involving Executive Board only when you think that your discussion with the other delegate will guide the debate further or when you feel the point that you have raised to the other delegate needs to be acknowledged by the Executive Board Members.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <h3>How to Deliver Speeches</h3>
                                    The key to writing effective speeches is to not just put your point across but also involve your creative side. This would help you to make your presence be felt in the committee in whatever way that you wish to. There are no particular 'right' formats or procedures for writing a speech and so, we intend to help you in writing one by sharing our experiences.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In our previous MUNs we have observed that some delegates prepare their speech for GSL before the conference and it is usually about the introduction to the agenda from their country’s perspective. It is somehow fruitful if you get a chance to speak as soon as the committee commences. However it naturally becomes ineffective if your first attempt at speaking in the GSL doesn’t happen on the first day. All delegates should therefore try to modify their speeches as soon as new points are raised in the committee so that the debate can progress accordingly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Usually delegates consume more than 15 seconds of their speech in saying “Thank you for the recognition. With the prior permission of the Executive Board, the delegate so and so would like to......” which is not that necessary. You can straightaway go to your point. There are time constraints. In case you feel you are violating diplomatic courtesy then you can just say “Thank you” and move to your point.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We have also observed that there are a few delegates who just introduce their foreign policy in the speech but fail to elaborate on the why factor of their policies. They will say they don’t agree with a particular point, but why they don’t agree with it, is something that they fail to put across. For instance, a country may claim that they will not grant citizenship to the refugees but at the same time, they will not justify their reasons for such an action. Also, there are times when delegates fail to understand that they are representing a country and have to follow the country’s perspective. The delegates may sometimes feel that their country does not have a strong stance regarding the agenda and therefore, they do not follow their foreign policy adequately. It then seems like a classroom discussion where people are debating on the agenda without role playing a diplomat. In such a situation, it is anything but natural to feel your own opinion about the agenda overpowering the stance of your country allotted. However, with
                                    persistent brainstorming and flexibility of thought patterns, solutions can easily be found.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Sometimes, delegates get carried away in explaining their foreign policy that it is not in accordance to the agenda. While we do realise it is important for you to know your country’s foreign policy, it is equally important for you to distinguish what is required in the agenda.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Due to paucity of time, we have seen delegates jumping from one point to another without explaining the first point adequately. As a result they end up raising an issue which some other delegate has already done and because they did not adequately explain it, the point is considered a repetition. So delegates should either try to add a point to the already raised issue or be as different as possible. We would appreciate one point which has been analysed from multiple perspectives than one point which is not analysed adequately and sounds repetitive.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are a few delegates who just read a text from some source itself including the background-guide. If the source in-itself analyses a particular point then it is fine. But usually they are facts and delegates don’t actually build upon them which is what is expected of them.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A lot of delegates have doubts such as what they are supposed to write or how should they should structure their speech. This is completely up to the delegate. The maximum we can do is to tell you according to our delegate experiences about how speeches are structured and content chosen for them accordingly. These are:
                                    <ul class="mt-20 mb-20">
                                        <li>Premise – Analysis – Example</li>
                                        <li>Problem – Solution – Benefits</li>
                                        <li>Past – Present – Future Scenario</li>
                                        <li>What – So what – Now what</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Note: </b>There can be more structures. These are some of them which the members of the Executive Board have seen. All that the delegate should bear in mind is that his speech is in sync with committee proceedings rather than proceeding along an isolated tangent that does not engage with or draw upon what is happening in committee.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Delegates should keep in mind that the committee requires substantial and effective debating and not polished oratory skills. A delegate must not feel uncomfortable to speak in the committee because (s)he may never know what substantive point spoken by them may be marked by the Executive Board. Moreover, delegates are requested to keep their speeches simple and clear for everyone’s understanding.
                                </p>
